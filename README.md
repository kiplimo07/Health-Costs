# Healthcare Cost Prediction Model

This project involves building a regression model to predict healthcare costs based on a dataset containing various attributes of individuals. The model uses a neural network architecture implemented in TensorFlow's Keras API. The goal is to achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 3500 on the test set.

## Introduction

In this challenge, the task is to predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm. We are provided with a dataset containing information about different individuals, including their healthcare costs (expenses). The objective is to train a model that can accurately predict healthcare costs based on new data.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, along with the target variable, `expenses`. The dataset is divided into features (`X`) and labels (`y`), where `y` represents the healthcare costs.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Feature Identification**: The dataset is divided into categorical and numerical columns. Categorical columns include `sex`, `smoker`, and `region`, while numerical columns include `age`, `BMI`, and `children`.

2. **One-Hot Encoding**: Categorical features are converted to numerical format using one-hot encoding, which creates binary columns for each category.

3. **Feature Combination**: The encoded categorical data and numerical data are combined into a single feature matrix.

4. **Data Splitting**: The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

## Model Architecture

The model is a neural network consisting of several dense layers with ReLU activation functions. The architecture includes:

- Input Layer: Matches the number of features in the dataset.
- Hidden Layers: Multiple dense layers with 128, 128, and 64 neurons, respectively.
- Dropout Layers: Applied to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 during training.
- Output Layer: A single neuron that outputs the predicted healthcare costs.

### Example Code

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_combined.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
```

## Training Process

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, a learning rate of 0.001, and the mean squared error loss function. The model is trained using the training set with a validation split of 20%. The batch size is set to 32, and the model is trained for 50 epochs.

### Example Code

```python
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mse', metrics=['mae', 'mse'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, validation_split=0.2, batch_size=32, verbose=2)
```

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated on the test set using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The evaluation is done by comparing the predicted values with the true labels (expenses).

### Evaluation Code

```python
loss, mae, mse = model.evaluate(test_dataset, test_labels, verbose=2)
print(f"Testing set Mean Abs Error: {mae:5.2f} expenses")
```

The challenge is considered successful if the MAE is less than 3500.

## Improvement Strategies

If the model's performance does not meet the required threshold (MAE < 3500), consider the following strategies:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that could be more predictive.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Standardize numerical features.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Increase Complexity**: Add more layers or neurons.
   - **Regularization**: Implement dropout layers or L2 regularization.

3. **Training Process**:
   - **Adjust Learning Rate**: Fine-tune the learning rate for better convergence.
   - **Increase Epochs**: Allow the model more time to learn the data patterns.
   - **Modify Batch Size**: Experiment with different batch sizes.

4. **Ensemble Methods**:
   - Combine multiple models to improve predictions.

## Usage

To use the model, ensure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
```
